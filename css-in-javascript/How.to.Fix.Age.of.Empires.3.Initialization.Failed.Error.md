## What is DATAP.BAR?
 
DATAP.BAR is one of the data files that contains the game's graphics, sounds, and other resources. It is located in the bin folder of the game's installation directory. For example, if you installed the game in C:\Program Files (x86)\Age of Empires III, then you should find DATAP.BAR in C:\Program Files (x86)\Age of Empires III\bin.
 
## Why does the error occur?
 
The error occurs when the game cannot find DATAP.BAR or other data files in the bin folder. This can happen for various reasons, such as:
 
- You moved or deleted the game folder manually without uninstalling it properly.
- You installed the game in a different drive or location than the default one.
- You have a corrupted or incomplete installation of the game.
- You have a conflict with another program or antivirus software that blocks or modifies the game files.

## How to fix it?
 
Depending on the cause of the error, you can try one or more of the following solutions:

1. Reinstall the game. This is the most straightforward and effective way to fix the error. Uninstall the game completely from your system, then reinstall it in the default location or a different one that you prefer. Make sure you have enough disk space and follow the installation instructions carefully.
2. Update your Windows Installer and run the Windows Installer Clean Up Utility. Sometimes, the error can be caused by a faulty or outdated Windows Installer service that prevents the game from installing or uninstalling correctly. To fix this, download and run the Windows Installer application installation and configuration service updater from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25). Then, download and run the Windows Installer Clean Up Utility from [here](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Windows-Installer-CleanUp-Utility.shtml). This tool will help you remove any leftover files or registry entries from previous installations of the game or other programs.
3. Edit your registry. If you installed the game in a different location than the default one, you might need to edit your registry to point to the correct path. To do this, open the Registry Editor by pressing Windows + R keys and typing regedit. Then, navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3\1.0 (for 64-bit systems) or HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3\1.0 (for 32-bit systems). In this table, you will find an entry called "SetupPath" that shows where the game is installed. Change this value to match your current installation path. For example, if you installed the game in D:\Games\Age of Empires III, then change "SetupPath" to D:\Games\Age of Empires III\bin.
4. Disable your antivirus or firewall software temporarily. Some antivirus or firewall software might interfere with the game files or prevent them from loading properly. To rule out this possibility, try disabling your antivirus or firewall software temporarily and see if the error goes away. If it does, then you might need to add an exception for the game folder or executable file in your antivirus or firewall settings.
